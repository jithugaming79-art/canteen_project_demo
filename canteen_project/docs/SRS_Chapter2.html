    <h2>2.1 Introduction</h2><br>The Smart College Canteen Management System (CampusBites) is a web-based application developed to modernize the traditional food ordering process in educational institutions. This chapter provides a detailed specification of the requirements for the system, covering everything from the purpose and scope to specific technical requirements and constraints. It serves as a foundational document for the development, testing, and deployment phases of the project.<br><br><h2>2.2 Purpose</h2><br>The primary purpose of this specification is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the Smart College Canteen Management System. It aims to eliminate long queues, improve order accuracy, enable cashless transactions, and provide real-time order tracking. This document provides a clear understanding of the system's goals and functionality for developers, stakeholders, and users, ensuring that the final product meets the needs of the college community.<br><br><h2>2.3 scope</h2><br>The scope of the project includes the development of a responsive web application for students, staff, and canteen administrators. Key features include user registration and authentication, a dynamic menu with filtering options, a shopping cart system, order placement with delivery preferences (pickup, classroom, or staffroom), a digital wallet for payments, QR code generation for order verification, and an admin dashboard for managing menu items and processing orders. The system focuses on a single canteen location and does not include real-world payment gateway integration or inventory management.<br><br><h2>2.4 Defination, Acronyms, Abbreviation</h2><br>- <strong>SRS</strong>: Software Requirement Specification<br>- <strong>DFD</strong>: Data Flow Diagram<br>- <strong>ER</strong>: Entity Relationship<br>- <strong>CRUD</strong>: Create, Read, Update, Delete<br>- <strong>UPI</strong>: Unified Payments Interface (Simulated)<br>- <strong>QR</strong>: Quick Response (code)<br>- <strong>UI</strong>: User Interface<br>- <strong>MVT</strong>: Model-View-Template (Architecture)<br>- <strong>ORM</strong>: Object-Relational Mapping<br>- <strong>Veg</strong>: Vegetarian<br>- <strong>Non-Veg</strong>: Non-Vegetarian<br>- <strong>Admin</strong>: Administrator<br>- <strong>CSRF</strong>: Cross-Site Request Forgery (Security)<br>- <strong>Wallet</strong>: Virtual balance for transactions<br>- <strong>Cart</strong>: Temporary storage for items before ordering<br><br><h2>2.5 Overview</h2><br>The Smart College Canteen Management System is structured to provide a seamless interaction between three primary user groups: Customers (Students/Staff), Kitchen Staff, and Administrators. The system is built using the Django framework with a MySQL database. It provides a front-end interface for browsing and ordering, and a back-end admin panel for management. This chapter outlines the detailed requirements necessary to build, maintain, and secure this ecosystem.<br><br><h2>2.6 Overal Description</h2><br>The system is a standalone web application designed specifically for college canteens. It replaces manual, paper-based processes with a digital platform. Users can access the system via any modern web browser on smartphones or laptops. It handles the complete lifecycle of a food order, from browsing the digital menu and selecting items to secure payment and real-time status updates until the order is collected or delivered to a specified campus location.<br><br><h2>2.7 Productive Perspective</h2><br>This system is part of a larger push toward campus digitalization. It integrates multiple sub-systems including:<br>- <strong>User Management</strong>: Handling profiles and role-based access.<br>- <strong>Menu System</strong>: Providing dynamic catalog management.<br>- <strong>Transaction System</strong>: Managing the digital wallet and simulated payments.<br>- <strong>Order Queue</strong>: Organizing kitchen operations and fulfillment.<br>- <strong>Notification System</strong>: Communicating status updates via the web UI and email.<br><br><h2>2.8 Product Function</h2><br>Major functions of the product include:<br>- User registration with role selection (Student/Teacher).<br>- Login via credentials or Social Media (Google/Facebook).<br>- Browsing the menu with category and dietary filters (Veg/Non-Veg).<br>- Adding items to a persistent shopping cart with custom instructions.<br>- Placing orders with specific delivery locations (Classrooms/Staffrooms).<br>- Cashless payments using a built-in wallet system.<br>- Real-time order status tracking with Token numbers and QR codes.<br>- Managing menu items, categories, and order fulfillment via Admin Dashboard.<br>- User review and rating system for quality feedback.<br><br><h2>2.9 User classes and Characteristics</h2><br>- <strong>Student User</strong>: Primary user class, frequent users, tech-savvy, uses mobile devices, needs fast ordering.<br>- <strong>Staff User</strong>: Faculty and administrative staff, uses laptops/mobiles, requires staffroom delivery.<br>- <strong>Admin User</strong>: Canteen managers/owners, manages menu items, prices, and systems access.<br>- <strong>Kitchen Staff</strong>: Personnel responsible for food prep, updates order status in real-time.<br><br><h2>2.10 Genral Constraints</h2><br>- Requires stable internet connectivity for all operations.<br>- Must be accessed through modern web browsers with JavaScript enabled.<br>- Limited to single-language (English) support in the current version.<br>- Data storage is constrained by the MySQL 8.0 environment.<br>- Responsive design must accommodate screen sizes from mobile to desktop.<br>- Orders can only be processed during canteen operational hours.<br><br><h2>2.11 Assumptions and Dependensies</h2><br>- <strong>Assumptions</strong>: Users have basic computer literacy; users have valid email IDs for registration; the canteen has a dedicated tablet or computer for the kitchen display.<br>- <strong>Dependensies</strong>: Relies on the Django 6.0 framework; depends on MySQL 8.0 database;
